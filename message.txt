Fly, fly, fly
It's Gucci (it's Gucci)
Huh? Fly (woo)
I drink 'til I'm drunk (yeah), smoke til I'm high (yeah)
Castle on the hill (well damn), wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
The ladies love the luxury (yeah),
That's why they all fuck with me (woo)
Out here with the moves (yeesh) like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly
Huh, huh, huh
I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
I got white girls blushin', homie, college girls rushin' on me (woo)
All my diamonds custom so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me
Ooh, pack his vegetables //PSTT!
Ooh, pack his edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond Number 9, nine
Section full of foreign dimes
Bitch is starin' at me sayin', "Wow"
Unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Gucci berry wine, don't sneak and tell your ho (well damn)
Her one night show, a human bank roll (whoa)
